#TODO-1 : Logo Printing
#TODO-2: What if the user enters a shift that is greater than the number of letters in the alphabet?
  #Try running the program and entering a shift number of 45.
  #Add some code so that the program continues to work even if the user enters a shift number greater than 26. 
  #Hint: Think about how you can use the modulus (%).
#TODO-3: What happens if the user enters a number/symbol/space?
    #Can you fix the code to keep the number/symbol/space when the text is encoded/decoded?
    #e.g. start_text = "meet me at 3"
    #end_text = "•••• •• •• 3"    
#TODO-4: Can you figure out a way to ask the user if they want to restart the cipher program?
#e.g. Type 'yes' if you want to go again. Otherwise type 'no'.
#If they type 'yes' then ask them for the direction/text/shift again and call the caesar() function again?
#Hint: Try creating a while loop that continues to execute the program if the user types 'yes'.
alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']


#TODO-1: Create a function called 'encrypt' that takes the 'text' and 'shift' as inputs.
def encrypt(text, shift):
    result = ""
    for c in text:
        if c in alphabet:
            position = alphabet.index(c)
            new_position = (position + shift) %len(alphabet)
            shifted_char = alphabet[new_position]
            result += shifted_char
        else:
            result += c
        
    return print(result)

        

        
#TODO-2: Inside the 'encrypt' function, shift each letter of the 'text' forwards in the alphabet by the shift amount and print the encrypted text.  
    #e.g. 
    #plain_text = "hello"
    #shift = 5
    #cipher_text = "mjqqt"
    #print output: "The encoded text is mjqqt"

    ##🐛Bug alert: What happens if you try to encode the word 'civilization'?🐛

#TODO-3: Call the encrypt function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a message.
